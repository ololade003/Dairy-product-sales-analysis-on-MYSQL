**Overview**

Welcome to the Dairy-Project-SQL-Analysis repository! This project contains SQL scripts for analyzing a dairy farm dataset, focusing on production, sales, revenue, and inventory management. The scripts create a table, populate it with data, and perform various queries to derive actionable insights from the dairy_project dataset.

**Contents**





dairyprojectsqlfile.sql: The SQL file containing table creation, data insertion, and analytical queries for the dairy project.

**Features**





**Table Creation**: Defines dairy_project2 with columns for location, farm metrics, product details, sales data, and inventory thresholds.



**Data Processing**: Inserts data from dairy_project with row numbering and converts date formats for analysis.



**Key Analyses**:





Revenue generation by farm size and product.



Average shelf life and its impact on revenue by product and storage condition.



Sales channel performance and order counts.



Location-based profitability and top-producing products.



Impact of price on quantity sold and top-selling products in high-revenue locations.

**Usage**








Open dairyprojectsqlfile.sql in a SQL editor (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver).



Ensure a MySQL database is set up with the dairy_project table populated.



Execute the script to create dairy_project2, insert data, and run queries.



Customize queries or dataset connections as needed.

**Installation**





**Requirements**: MySQL server (or compatible SQL engine).



Import the script into your SQL environment and adjust table names or data sources if necessary.
